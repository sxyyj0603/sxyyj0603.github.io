Welcome to my homepage! 

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the [https://statistics.stanford.edu/ Statistics Department] at Stanford University, advised by Professor [https://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/ Emmanuel Candès]. 

Previously I got my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley, advised by Professors [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bickel/ Peter Bickel] and [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/ Michael Jordan]. I was also very fortunate to be supervised by Professors [https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/noureddine-el-karoui Noureddine El Karoui], [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~wfithian/ William Fithian], [https://sites.google.com/site/pengdingpku/ Peng Ding], [https://gsppi.berkeley.edu/avi-feller/, Avi Feller] and [https://polisci.berkeley.edu/people/person/jasjeet-sekhon, Jasjeet Sekhon] on particular projects. Prior to this, I was major in mathematics and statistics in [http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/ School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University] with an economic minor in [http://www.nsd.pku.edu.cn/ China Center for Economic Research at Peking University]. I was pleased to be a research assistant with Professor [http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/static/interface/people.htm?uid=wul Lan Wu] and supervised by Professor [http://www.public.iastate.edu/~songchen/ Song Xi Chen] on my undergraduate thesis.

I am currently a co-organizer of the [https://www.selectiveinferenceseminar.com/ International Seminar on Selective Inference] (with Will Fithian, Rina Barber and Daniel Yekutieli). Previously, I co-organized the GRoup-Of-Why (GROW) seminar on causal inference at Stanford University (with Guillaume Basse and Dominik Rothenhäusler), the Banff workshop [https://www.birs.ca/events/2020/5-day-workshops/20w5214 "The Interface Between Selective Inference and Machine Learning"] (with Will Fithian, Rina Barber and Daniel Yekutieli, cancelled due to the pandemic), and the Banff workshop [https://www.birs.ca/events/2020/5-day-workshops/20w5210 "Causal Inference with Big Data"] (with Peng Ding, Marloes Maathuis and Fabrizia Mealli, cancelled due to the pandemic).
